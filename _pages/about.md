I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Energy Sciences & Engineering](https://earth.stanford.edu/ere) Department at [Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/)
working with Professor [Sally M. Benson](https://earth.stanford.edu/people/sally-benson). My research interest is in computational methods for earth sciences. I specialize in multiphase flow and transport for CO$_2$ geological storage, physics modeling, and machine learning. 

I am is currently an ExxonMobil Emerging Energy Fellow through the [Stanford Strategic Energy Alliance](https://news.stanford.edu/2018/03/01/new-energy-research-program-collaboration/). 
I received my Master's degree in Fluid Mechanics and Hydrology from Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University.
Prior to my Ph.D. Stanford, I received her Bachelor's degree with honors from Lassonde Mineral Engineering at University of Toronto and nominated as [16 Grads to Watch](https://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/grads-watch-16-global-engineering-leaders/).



Check out [ccsnet.ai](http://ccsnet.ai), a machine learning-based web application for real-time CO$_2$ plume migration and pressure buildup prediction. This web application provides 1,000 predictions per day to researchers, students, regulators, and industrial users across the world.
