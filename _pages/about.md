I'm a Ph.D. candidate in geodetection & information technology at Ultrasonics Lab, [Institute of Acoustics](http://english.ioa.cas.cn/) , University of Chinsese Academy of Sciences. My research interest is in computing and imaging for earth science and ultrasonics, with a particular emphasis on active-source time-lapse monitoring for CO$_2$ storage/sequestration and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS). These applications are based on the attenuation waveform inversion (Q-FWI) and active acoustical imaging.

Currently, I hold a visiting student position at [Environmental Geophysics Group (EGG)](https://sites.psu.edu/tzhu/group/) Pennsylvania State University, working with Professor [Tieyuan Zhu](https://www.geosc.psu.edu/directory/tieyuan-zhu). I focus on CO$_2$ plumes and leakage characterization with high-resolution Q-FWI and look for cooperation with reseachers who share related research insterests.
