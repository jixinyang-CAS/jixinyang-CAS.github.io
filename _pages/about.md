> __Update:__ I will be starting as an assistant professor at Imperial College London in January 2024, with a co-appointment from [Earth Science Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/) and [I-X (Imperial + AI)](https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/). My group focuses on AI for Energy Transition, with special emphasis on subsurface energy storage and CO$_2$ geological storage. Please reach out if you are interested in [Ph.D. opportunity](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/grantham-institute/public/dtp/2024-projects/grantham-institute-2024-projects/2024_27_ESE_GW.pdf) in Fall 2024!

My research interest is in computational methods for earth sciences, with a special emphasis on multiphase flow and transport for CO$_2$ geological storage, physics modeling, and machine learning. I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Energy Sciences & Engineering](https://earth.stanford.edu/ere) Department at [Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/)
working with Professor [Sally M. Benson](https://earth.stanford.edu/people/sally-benson). I was an ExxonMobil Emerging Energy Fellow through the [Stanford Strategic Energy Alliance](https://news.stanford.edu/2018/03/01/new-energy-research-program-collaboration/). 


I received my Master's degree in Fluid Mechanics and Hydrology from Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University. Prior to my Ph.D. at Stanford, I received my Bachelor's degree with honors from Lassonde Mineral Engineering at the University of Toronto and was nominated as [16 Grads to Watch](https://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/grads-watch-16-global-engineering-leaders/).


Check out [ccsnet.ai](http://ccsnet.ai), a machine learning-based web application for real-time CO$_2$ plume migration and pressure buildup prediction. This web application provides 1,000 predictions per day to researchers, students, regulators, and industrial users across the world.
