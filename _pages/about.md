> __Update:__ I'm looking for a postdoc position strating from 2025 Spring. Please drop me an emial if you think I would be a good fit for your group. Thanks!

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate specializing in geodetection and information technology at the Ultrasonics Lab, part of the [Institute of Acoustics](http://english.ioa.cas.cn/) , University of Chinsese Academy of Sciences. My research primarily revolves around computational and imaging techniques within earth science and ultrasonics. I have a particular focus on active-source time-lapse monitoring for CO₂ storage/sequestration and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), utilizing attenuation waveform inversion (Q-FWI) and active acoustical imaging methods.

In addition to my studies, I am engaged as a visiting student with the [Environmental Geophysics Group (EGG)](https://sites.psu.edu/tzhu/group/) at Pennsylvania State University, under the mentorship of Professor [Tieyuan Zhu](https://www.geosc.psu.edu/directory/tieyuan-zhu). My work here is centered on characterizing CO₂ plumes and leakages through high-resolution Q-FWI. I am actively seeking collaboration with researchers who have a shared interest in these areas of study.

My expertise lies at the intersection of applied mathematics and applied geophysics:
  - **Numerical Simulation of Partial Derivative Equation** 
    - Frequency-domain Finite-difference Method
    - Finite Element Method
    - Absorbing Boundary Conditions
    - Viscoelastic Anisotropic Wave Equation
  - **Wave-equation based Imaging & Inversion**
    -  Attenuation Compensation Reverse Time Migration
    -  Attenuation Full Waveform Inversion
    -  Time-lapse  Monitoring
  - **Seismic Interpretation**
    -  Pre-stack AVO Invserion
    -  Time-frequency Analysis
    -  Rock physics and borehole constrained Inversion
