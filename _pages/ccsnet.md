[CCSNet.ai](https://ccsnet.ai) is a web application developed by Gege Wen at Stanford University, advised by Prof. Sally M. Benson. 

CCSNet.ai is hosted on Microsoft Azure, providing an average of ***1,000 predictions per day*** to researchers, students, regulators, and industrial users across North America, Europe, and Asia. This web app predicts CO$_2$ gas saturation plume migration and pressure for Synthetic Heterogeneous, Homogeneous, Purely layered, and User upload isotropic permeability maps. 

The isotropic cases are predicted with pre-trained convolutional neural network models [(Wen et al., 2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0309170821001640). 

Anisotropic permeability maps are supported with the Synthetic Heterogeneous option, predicted with pre-trained enhanced Fourier neural operators [(Wen et al., 2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0309170822000562).
